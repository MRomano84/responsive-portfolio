# My Responsive Portfolio

The assignment was to create a responsive portfolio that dynamically changes based on the screen size of the person viewing. Essentially, I needed to create a portfolio page that adjusted itself to the screen of the viewer using Bootstrap CSS framework.

## What I needed to create this

Must include: Navbar with working links, a responsive layout, and responsive images.

## Process

I began by using a bootstrap cdn to find a navbar. I also found content cards that I could add images and text to to create the portfolio/gallery and contact info pages. I then basically was playing with the bootstrap grid system to try out different layouts to create a page that was aesthetically pleasing. I then found a complementary color scheme and began adding and linking images. I changed the layout based on size of the pictures so the gallery page would look better. At first, I was using a lot of inline styleing. I decided to put all of my css into their own documents to clean up the HTML code.

## Result

I worked on this project over the course of about 5 days. The layout and content changed many times. In the future I would replace the images with either screenshots of work I have done or links to things I have created (apps, webpages, etc.) to show to potential employers.
